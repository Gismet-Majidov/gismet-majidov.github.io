I just wanted to take notes for myself and decided to make the process a little fancy by setting up this website. So what I post here is random stuffs that I might do during a day, sometimes I may post some rough ideas, other times I may post something better, like more of a tutorial kind of thing, and yet other times it might be posts related to problems, mathematics, computer science, or something quite unexpected. You get the idea. No need to throw around big lofty words any further.
